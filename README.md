Web3 Chess is a decentralized chess platform built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) testnet. Here, you can stake cryptocurrency, mint NFTs of your matches, earn unique NFT rewards, and participate in a vibrant marketplace—all while enjoying the strategic gameplay of chess.

## Introduction

Chess is more than just a game; it's an intellectual challenge enjoyed by millions worldwide. With Web3 Chess, we've taken this classic game to the next level by integrating blockchain technology, allowing players to stake cryptocurrency, mint NFTs of their matches, earn unique NFT rewards, and participate in a vibrant marketplace.

### About Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

It aims to provide a fast and low-cost alternative to Ethereum, making it ideal for decentralized applications like Web3 Chess. BSC is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to easily port their Ethereum-based projects to BSC and benefit from its high throughput and low transaction fees.

## Challenges and Solutions

Building Web3 Chess presented its own set of challenges, particularly for a team with limited experience in full-stack dApp development. However, we overcame these challenges by experimenting with various tools and technologies, ultimately migrating to Moralis midway through the project for its powerful features such as live queries, custom React hooks, easy authentication, and seamless integration with the Binance Smart Chain.
